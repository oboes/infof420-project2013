<h1>3. Segment Distance</h1>

<p id="subtitle">&mdash; for the impatient : <a href="./app3.html">a chain builder</a> &mdash;</p>

<p>
Like promised at the end of the previous page, we now present a simple way of checking if a polygonal chain self-intersects.
As the title imply, the difficulty of this problem lies in computing the distance between two segments in 3D space.
Indeed, let us suppose we have a <code>segdis(a0, a1, b0, b1)</code> function, which gives us the distance between line segments
\([a_0 a_1]\) and \([b_0 b_1]\). Then finding the segments of a polygonal chain that are in a collision is easy.
In pseudocode, we could do :
</p>

<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false;">
function collisions( p )
    for i in 0..n-1 do
        c[i] := false
    for i in 0..n-1 do
        for j in i+2..n-1 do
            if segdis( p[i], p[i+1], p[j], p[j+1] ) &lt; SMALL
                c[i] := true
                c[j] := true
    return c
</pre>

<p>
This function takes as input the vertices of a polygonal chain and gives us back an array <code>c</code> of boolean values,
with <code>(c[i] = true)</code> if and only if the \(i\)th segment intersects another segment of the chain.
The <code>SMALL</code> constant is a small positive value depending on the thickness of the chain in our particular implementation.

So what we need is a way to compute the distance between two line segments.
To see how to do this, let us first introduce some notation.
We want the distance between segments \([a_0 a_1]\) and \([b_0 b_1]\), and we let :
\[
    u := (a_1 - a_0) \qquad v := (b_0 - b_1) \qquad w := (b_0 - a_0)
\]
So we have the following parameterizations for our two segments :
\[
    a_x := a_0 + x\,u \qquad b_y := b_0 - y\,v
\]
That is, the points on \([a_0 a_1]\) are the points \(a_x\) for \(0 \leq x \leq 1\),
and similarly for \([b_0 b_1]\). The distance between points \(a_x\) and \(b_y\) is :
\[
    f(x,y) := | a_x - b_y |^2 = | x\,u + y\,v - w |^2
\]
And computing the distance between the two segments is the same than solving the following problem :
\[ \begin{align}
\text{min}  & f(x,y) \\
\text{s.t.} & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
            & 0 \leq y \leq 1
\end{align} \]
The function \(f\) being quadratic, this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming">quadratic programming</a> problem,
for which there exist general solving algorithms. But it would be a bit overkill to implement a whole quadratic solver for our comparatively
easy segment distance problem ! So we want a more direct way of computing the distance. I will more or less follow the explanations in
<a href="http://geomalgorithms.com/a07-_distance.html">this article by Dan Sunday</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
As a first step, we compute the distance between the two <em>lines</em> \((a_0 a_1)\) and \((b_0 b_1)\).
Let us suppose that \(x\) and \(y\) minimize \(f(x,y)\), without any constraint on \(x\) or \(y\), i.e. one or both of them
could be outside the \([0,1]\) interval.
Then the lines \((a_0 a_1)\) and \((b_0 b_1)\) are closest at points \(a_x\) and \(b_y\) respectively,
and it is clear that the segment \([a_x b_y]\) is simultaneously perpendicular to each of the two lines (see the picture).
</p>

<img src="./lines.png" alt="perpendicular to two lines">

<p>
So, using the scalar product, we know that :

\[ \begin{align}
0 & = (a_1 - a_0)  \cdot  (a_x - b_y) = u  \cdot  (x\,u + y\,v - w) \\
0 & = (b_0 - b_1)  \cdot  (a_x - b_y) = v  \cdot  (x\,u + y\,v - w)
\end{align} \]

Which brings us to the following system of linear equations :

\[
\begin{pmatrix} u  \cdot  u & u  \cdot  v \\ v  \cdot  u & v  \cdot  v \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u  \cdot  w \\ v  \cdot  w \end{pmatrix}
\]

The determinant of this system is :

\[
    \Delta = (u  \cdot  u)(v  \cdot  v) - (u  \cdot  v)^2 = |u \times v|^2
\]

Because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Lagrange.27s_identity">this classic identity</a>.
Remark that we now see why I chose to use the \(u,v,w\) vectors : it allows us to write the linear system and its determinant in a nice and tidy form.
</p>

<p>
When \(\Delta \neq 0\), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule">Cramer's rule</a> gives us :
\[ \begin{align}
x & = \frac{ (u \cdot w)(v \cdot v)-(u \cdot v)(v \cdot w) }{ \Delta } = \frac{ (u \times v) \cdot (w \times v) }{ \Delta } \\
y & = \frac{ (u \cdot u)(v \cdot w)-(u \cdot w)(v \cdot u) }{ \Delta } = \frac{ (u \times v) \cdot (u \times w) }{ \Delta }
\end{align} \]

When \(\Delta = 0\), the two vectors \(u\) and \(v\) are proportional, so the two equations are dependent,
and we can choose any value for \( x \) and then use one of the two equations of the system to find the value of \( y \).
For example, by putting \(x:=0\) into the second equation, we get :
\[ \begin{align}
    x & = 0 \\
    y & = \frac{v \cdot w}{v \cdot v}
\end{align} \]
The geometric meaning behind this is that when \(\Delta = 0\), the two lines are parallel (because \(u\) and \(v\) are proportional),
and so the distance from \(a_x\) to the line \((b_0 b_1)\) is the same for every \(x\).

We now go back to the problem of finding the distance between the <em>segments</em> \([a_0 a_1]\) and \([b_0 b_1]\),
that is we want to find the \((\hat{x},\hat{y}) \in [0,1]\times[0,1]\) for which \(f(\hat{x},\hat{y})\) is the smallest possible.
Let us first compute the global minimum \((x_0,y_0)\) of \(f(x,y)\), using the formulas we just found.
If \((x_0,y_0)\) is inside the square \([0,1]\times[0,1]\), we have nothing to do,
so suppose that it is outside. In the \(xy\)-plane, we have the following picture :
</p>

<img src="./square.png" alt="domain of f in the xy-plane">

<p>
Now, \(f(x,y)\) defines a paraboloid over the \(xy\)-plane with a minimum at \((x_0,y_0)\),
so the value of \(f\) increases along the rays starting at \((x_0,y_0)\).
So the point \((\hat{x},\hat{y})\) will be on one of the edges of \([0,1]\times[0,1]\),
i.e. at least one of the following is true :
\(\hat{x}=0\), \(\hat{y}=0\), \(\hat{x}=1\), or \(\hat{y}=1\).
</p>

<p>
Suppose that \(\hat{x}=0\).
We compute the minimum of \(f\) on the \(x=0\) line by taking the derivative of
\(f(0,y)\) with respect to \(y\) and equating it to \(0\) :
\[
    \frac{d}{dy} f(0,y) = 2 \, v \cdot (y\,v - w) = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad y = \frac{ v \cdot w }{ v \cdot v }
\]
If \( \frac{ v \cdot w }{ v \cdot v } \in [0,1] \) then \( (0, \frac{ v \cdot w }{ v \cdot v }) \) will be a candidate for \((\hat{x},\hat{y})\).
If \( \frac{ v \cdot w }{ v \cdot v } &lt; 0 \) it is \( (0,0) \) that is a candidate,
and if \( \frac{ v \cdot w }{ v \cdot v } &gt; 1 \) it is \( (0,1) \).
So in all case we get a candidate for \((\hat{x},\hat{y})\).
</p>

<p>
By doing this for every edge of \([0,1]\times[0,1]\) we find a maximum of four candidates.
We now just have to evaluate \(f(x,y)\) on every candidate, and picking the candidate on which \(f\) is the smallest.
</p>

<p>
Remark that the only place where we used the fact that the line segments are in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) is when using the cross
product to allow for prettier formulas. Indeed, the line segments don't need to be in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) for the method to work,
so we actually get an algorithm for computing the distance between two line segments in \( \mathbb{R}^n \), for any \( n \geq 2 \) !

<p>
The Three.js example making use of polygonal chain collision detection I made is <a href="./app3.html">app3.html</a>.
It is an application that let you build and fold a polygonal chain, and it detects self-intersections
so you can't make the chain pass through itself.
The implementation will not be discussed here.
