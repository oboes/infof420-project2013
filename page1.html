<p>
We would like to make simple 3D applications that can be executed in a browser.
The preferred way to do this in 2013 (that is, without resorting to things such as Flash or Java applets) is to
use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a>.
The latter being a somewhat low-level API, we will use one of the <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/User_Contributions#Frameworks">many</a>
WebGL frameworks available so we don't waste our time on trivialities.
There doesn't seem to be a preferred JavaScript 3D library yet, so the choice of a particular one is difficult
(StackOverflow has <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webgl+frameworks?sort=votes">plenty of questions</a>
about the choice of a WebGL framework).
Here are a few that seem popular at the time of writing :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>
        is very simple, often used for pedagogical purposes, and the one recommended by my professor.
        However, its focus is on 2D, and even though it can do 3D as well it is a bit limited
        compared to other 3D libraries.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.scenejs.org/">Scene.js</a>
        is interesting because it was made for visualizations in engineering and medical fields.
        The website even says it is specialized towards fast rendering of large numbers of individually articulated objects,
        which is exactly the kind of things we want to do here.
        Unfortunately I found this particular library to be a bit difficult to use for a newcomer like me.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.threejs.org/">Three.js</a>
        is the one I have chosen to use for this project.
        It seems to be mostly used for video games and computer art, things that are maybe a bit less serious
        than a Computational Geometry course, but it benefits from an active community, and it is especially
        designed "for dummies", according to its website.
        So it is easy to use if like me you aren't very comfortable with 3D graphics programming, yet
        it is still powerful enough for our needs.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
So what will follow is a brief tutorial on how to use Three.js to make small 3D applications.
This tutorial is meant to cover only the very basics, just enough to do interesting things later.
</p>

<p>
The first thing we have to do is to download the
<a href="https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/build/three.js">Three.js file</a> and link it
as an external JavaScript file in our HTML code the usual way. We do the same for the
<a href="https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/js/controls/TrackballControls.js">TrackballControls.js file</a>,
which will provide a simple way to navigate around the 3D scene using the mouse (so we don't have to implement this part ourselves).
Our HTML file should look something like this :
</p>

<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false;">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;script src="./path/to/Three.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="./path/to/TrackballControls.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;

            // JavaScript code, coming soon

        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>
That is all we need as long as HTML is concerned. Coming now is some example JavaScript code for
a minimal toy application. The code is heavily commented in order to be self-explanatory.
</p>

<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false;">
// create a new application
var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

// we want it fullscreen
renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );

// put the application at the end of the &lt;body&gt; element
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// create the camera
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    45,                                     // field of view
    window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, // aspect ratio
    0.01,                                   // near plane
    1000                                    // far plane
);

// the camera by default is at (0,0,0),
// so we put it a bit further away from the origin
camera.position.set( 0, 0, 10 );

// mouse controls (needs TrackballControls.js)
var controls = new THREE.TrackballControls( camera );

// create the scene containing the models to be displayed
var scene = new THREE.Scene();

// create a cube and add it to the scene
var cube = new THREE.Mesh(
    new THREE.CubeGeometry( 1, 1, 1 ),
    new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { wireframe: true } )
);
scene.add( cube );

// create an axis helper and add it to the scene
scene.add( new THREE.AxisHelper() );

// main loop
function animate() {

    // the function must be called every frame
    requestAnimationFrame( animate );

    // update the controls
    controls.update();

    // rotate the cube a little bit
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

    // render the scene
    renderer.render( scene, camera );
};

// launch the animation
animate();
</pre>

<p>
That is all ! What this code does is displaying a rotating  wire-frame model of a 3D cube,
along with an axis helper (red-green-blue segments for the x-y-z axis), and it is possible
to navigate around this scene using the mouse (left-click to rotate, right-click to pan,
and wheel to zoom).
Check <a href="./app1.html">app1.html</a> to see it in action.
</p>

<p>
A few more things to know for using Three.js :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Most of the time, a Three.js animation works like this :
        <ul>
            <li>
                The renderer, camera, scene, lights, and so on are set up.
            </li>
            <li>
                3D models are created (or loaded from a file) and added to the scene.
            </li>
            <li>
                A function, usually called <code>animate</code>, is in charge of what needs to be done at every frame,
                e.g. rendering the objects on the canvas, or maybe updating the orientation or position of some object
                if we want it to be rotating or moving (like the cube in our example).
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/event">DOM event listeners</a>
                are set up to manage user inputs,
                e.g. a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Mozilla_Event_Reference/click">mouse click</a>
                could change the position of an object, or trigger the creation of a new object to be added to the scene.
            </li>
        </ul>
        In particular, this means that Three.js does not provide any API to handle user inputs. Three.js is a 3D library
        and nothing else, so it is necessary to learn the basics of DOM events handling in order to do interactive applications.
    </li>
    <li>
        With Three.js comes a class for handling <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/58/#Reference/Math/Vector3">3D vectors</a>
        along with the expected features (addition, scalar multiplication, dot/cross product, rotation matrices,...).
        We will try to take advantage of these features instead of diving into basic trigonometry every time we
        need to rotate something.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maybe the most important class provided by Three.js is <code><a href="http://threejs.org/docs/58/#Reference/Core/Object3D">THREE.Object3D</a></code>,
        the base class for most 3D objects.
        When 3D models are created using constructors like
        <code><a href="http://threejs.org/docs/58/#Reference/Objects/Mesh">THREE.Mesh</a>(
        <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/58/#Reference/Core/Geometry">geometry</a>,
        <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/58/#Reference/Materials/Material">material</a> )</code>
        or <code><a href="http://threejs.org/docs/58/#Reference/Objects/Line">THREE.Line</a></code>,
        it is subclasses of <code>THREE.Object3D</code> that are returned.
        It is also possible of
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model#Subclasses_and_inheritance">subclassing</a>
        the <code>THREE.Object3D</code> class, or a subclass of it, to make our own 3D objects constructors.
        A simple example of this can be seen by looking at the code for the
        <code><a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/extras/helpers/AxisHelper.js">THREE.AxisHelper</a></code> constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Three interesting properties of <code>THREE.Object3D</code> are :
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>.position</code> is the 3D vector specifying the position of the object.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>.rotation</code> is the 3D vector specifying the orientation of the object,
                in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles">Euler angles</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>.scale</code> is the 3D vector specifying the x-y-z scaling of the object.
            </li>
        </ul>
        It is strongly encouraged to use these properties whenever possible, and to avoid directly modifying
        the geometry of an object (which is costly performance-wise).
    </li>
    <li>
        Another useful property of <code>THREE.Object3D</code> is <code>.children</code>, which is an array containing other instances
        of <code>THREE.Object3D</code>. An object can be added or removed to this array using the <code>.add(object)</code>
        and <code>.remove(object)</code> methods. This way, an instance of <code>THREE.Object3D</code> can be used
        as a container for smaller, individually articulated objects, which is what we will do later when implementing a
        "polygonal chain" class.
    </li>
    <li>
        Three.js being aimed towards video games, it can also handle eye candy such as lights and textures, even though
        our example didn't make use of this.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
I think this should be enough for introducing Three.js.
For more help with using the library, the reader is advised to look at the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki">wiki</a>,
the <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/">documentation</a>, the many
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples">examples on GitHub</a>,
the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js">relevant tag on StackOverflow</a>, and so on.
Please note that Three.js is still in constant development, so the documentation isn't always up-to-date and features
can appear or disappear from one version to the next. Because of this, in order to understand better how to use it
it is often useful to not only rely on docs and tutorials but to also take a look at the Three.js source code.
